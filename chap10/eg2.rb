# recursive loop is equivalent to telling the computer to do 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

# 5 * factorial(5-1)
# 4 * factorial(3)
# 3 * factorial(2)

# num is now 1 so we return 1 (append 1 to our algorithm) and exit the method
# so 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

# the factorial of an integer is the product
# of all the integers from itself down to 1
# e.g. 3 x 2 x 1 = 6
